This project will help you write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This command line interpreter  serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

Also the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating a parent class called (BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of the instances
-   Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
-   Creating new objects (for example: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object
